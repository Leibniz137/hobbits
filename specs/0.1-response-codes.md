# Response Codes

The EWP defines various response codes inspired by [HTTP Status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

## `200` Ok

This response code is considered the **default** code. It is returned when the request could be answered as is expected.

## `400` Bad Request

This response code is returned when the `message` is malformed e.g. does not contain the required fields.

## `403` Forbidden

This response code is returned when the caller is not allowed to access specific data.

## `404` Not Found

This response code is returned when a lookup or similar function against a node returned empty results.

## `406` Request Compression Unsupported

This response code is returned when the chosen request compression codec is unsupported by the server.

## `407` Response Compression Unsupported

This response code is returned when none of the requested response compression preferences are supported.

## `418` Not a Blockchain

This response code is returned when the node software refuses to cooperate because it is not actually a blockchain.

## `500` Internal Server Error

This response code is returned when a node experiences some form of internal error that causes it to fail handling the request as expected.

## `501` Not Implemented

This response code is returned when the node does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. This is the appropriate response when the node does not recognize the request command and is not capable of supporting it.
